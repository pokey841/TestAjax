TestAjax
========

First pass at loading images based on WebCTRL Demo system OA Enthalpy

This project was to work out a number of technical issues:
  1.) Pulling data from WebCTRL, and displaying it on a web page
  2.) Using jquery to update on the page on a regular interval
  3.) Display a bar graph image from a list based on the value of the data
